# Genetic Algorithm

This project consists of a genetic algorithm (heuristic, stochastic) that, given a `set of genes`, creates a population that converges to that set using Darwinian Principles.

## Algorithm Description

The first generation is obtained by randomising every individual, where each individual is characterized by its genes. Then for each individual its fitness is estimated through comparison of its genes and the target `set of genes`. The next generation is then created using individuals from the current generation, by using methods of crossover and mutation. This process is repeated until the maximum number of generations is reached, or when at least one individual obtains the target `set of genes`.

Crossover consists of the combination of any 2 individuals of a given generation, and it works on combining the good genes already in the population. Individuals are picked to be parents based on their fitness (higher is better). Mutation changes genes randomly of a given individual, and is a method used to bring new genes into the population.

## Input Parameters

- `Target Set of Genes`, genes that at least one element of the population should obtain;
- `Population Size`, number of elements of the population;
- `Elitism`, rate of children that are obtained through the crossover of two of the best parents of a given generation.
- `Mutation Rate`, mutation rate of each gene after the crossover;
- `Maximum Number of Generations`, maximum number of generations that the population has to achieve the target string.
